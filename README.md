# Alpaca Generator
A project written in React that allows users to create unique alpaca designs. The application enables users to choose accessories and body parts (such as fur, eyes, mouth, background, and many more) to customize the alpaca's appearance according to their preferences. Once the configuration is complete, the final alpaca image can be generated and saved as a graphic file.
